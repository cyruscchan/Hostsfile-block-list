## Getting started

### Windows 10 users

`hosts` path is on `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`. And recommended using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to modify `hosts` file since it required administrator's priviledge

### UNIX and UNIX-like users (including Mac OS, Linux)

`hosts` mostly stored on `/etc` files, you can type `sudo nano /etc/hosts` for modifications
